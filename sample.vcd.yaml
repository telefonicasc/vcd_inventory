# Metadata property that contains the ansible host group.
# This property contains the sequence of ansible groups to
# which the VMs belong.
#
# consecutive groups are nested, i.e. if this variable is set
# to "pre3, pre3-iot, pre3-iot-hadoop, pre3-iot-hadoop-ab", then
# the ansible inventory will have this structure:
#
# pre3:
#   pre3-iot:
#     pre3-iot-hadoop:
